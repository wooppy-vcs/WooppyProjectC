~  100  people;  Mainly  involved  in  the  safety  and  control  section  of  the  project  which  considers  the 
safety aspects  of  the  design such  as creating site  layout, carrying out  hazard  and  operability analysis 
(HAZOP)  and  the control  operation of the plant  such as designing the  Piping  & Instrument  Diagram 
(P&ID) for the main units of the plant.
Final Year Research project – B+ (69/100)
Investigation of  particle-stabilized  bubbles  in  a  controlled  manner; Experiments showed  that  bubbles 
can be destabilized by the decreasing the temperature caused by the undersaturation of the bubbles in 
solution;  Data  is  reliable that  can  be  further  studied  by  the  current  researchers (V.  Poulichet  and  V.
Garbin) on their research field in Flow and Dynamics of Soft Matter
